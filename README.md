# MOSAIC: Multi-Organism Spaceflight Analysis and Integrated Comparison
This project is currently under construction.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to gather information on the orthologis gene disregulation from species to species or kingdom to kingdom that occurs during spaceflight. Spaceflight research is often limited by high costs, intensive resource requirements, and difficulties in replicating studies. To accelerate future discoveries, it is crucial to consolidate existing data. This model will facilitate the comparison of dysregulated orthologous genes from various spaceflight experiments, offering insights into the biological responses to spaceflight.

## Important Considerations
While this model enables the simultaneous comparison of multiple studies involving similar or different species, we recommend analyzing no more than five studies at a time to maintain data integrity. It is important to acknowledge that due to the inherent limitations of spaceflight research, such as small sample sizes and limited replicatations, data sets may be disparate. For example, a study with five subjects of one species may be compared to another with 25 subjects of a different species, which could potentially skew the results.
